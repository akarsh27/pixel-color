/*Make a magenta square that is 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high, like this:


Think through the steps you will need to do to solve this problem. You will need to:

1. Create a new image, specifying that the new image is 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.

2. Then, for each pixel in that image:

Make the pixel magenta 
Magenta has a red value of 255, a green value of 0, and a blue value of 255*/
//start of the code
var img = new SimpleImage(200,200);
for(var pixel of img.values())
{
    var newB=255-pixel.getBlue();//getting new blue value
    var newR=255-pixel.getRed();//getting new red value
    pixel.setBlue(newB);//converting initial blue into finalt blue value
    pixel.setRed(newR);//converting initial red into final red value
}  
  print(img);
